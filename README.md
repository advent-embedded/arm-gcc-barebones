arm-gcc-barebones
=================

Quick project to get gcc-arm working for my LPC1768. The result is a combination of a makefile, linker file, and a few c files to get started.

I started by exporting a simple blinky program from the MBED online compiler. It generated the makefile and supplied all additional needed files.

Once I tested by compiling myself and running the blinky, I began removing MBED stuff and replacing it with plain old C. Eventually, I was able to remove all the precompiled MBED libraries.

You can look through the commit history to see what I did. :-)


NOTES:

* I used the pre-compiled arm-gcc from https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded
* Initial autogenerated makefile and most support files came from http://mbed.org/
* startup_LPC17xx.c came from code examples in http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers/cortex_m3/LPC1768FBD100.html#documentation
